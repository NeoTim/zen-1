#The Zen of Programming

### simple C code to display the zen of programming
 
Code and poetry can both be very zen.
When first learning Python, the first thing I did was type `import this`.
I thought the poem or series of statements by Tim Peters was great.
I still see a lot of truth and beauty in these statements.
I look at code as art.

### Usage

    git clone https://gradus@github.com/gradus/zen.git
    cd zen
    sudo cp zen /usr/local/bin
    
Now, you can just simply type `zen` from your console anytime you need a reminder of the these truths.
